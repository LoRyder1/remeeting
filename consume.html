    // Your code should go here
    // Reminders on the task:
    //   1. Use the Remeeting API and wiki at https://bitbucket.org/remeeting/mrp-api/wiki and https://api-dev.remeeting.com/v0.3
      //      a. Authorization - user authentication and resource authorization is done via a token that is sent as a header.
      //         To get you started the test user's token is  nGVhDpbr2wjs8FgsecMXHpdJ .
    //      b. To access resources, in this case a user's meetings, you could use command-line tool as follows:
    //         curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer nGVhDpbr2wjs8FgsecMXHpdJ" https://api-dev.remeeting.com/v0.3/meeting/
    //   2. Find the quiz user's oldest meeting and get a presigned S3 url for audio_stereo.m4a
    //      - Don't try to read and understand all of the docs, that'd be overwhelming!
    //          The important parts are 'Endpoints and HTTP Verbs - Get /{resource}/' which will help you get the oldest meeting,
    //        and 'Access to S3 data resources - Get /{resource}/data/$resid/$path' which will help you get the s3 presigned url
    //   3. Use a html5 video element on this page to play the audio_stereo.m4a
    //
    // Important Note: This isn't meant to be a trick question, or a stumbling block. If the API docs are confusing,
    //  assume it is on us. Please reach out to us via email with questions, and we'll respond with answers or schedule
    //  time to talk through your questions.
